Authentication library for Phoenix, and other Plug-based, web applications.

Phauxth is designed with Phoenix 1.3 in mind, but it can also be used with
older versions of Phoenix and any other Plug-based application. It is
designed to be secure, extensible and well-documented.

For a general overview of some of the goals of Phauxth and its basic usage,
see [this post](https://riverrun.github.io/projects/phauxth/2017/09/25/phauxth.html).

[This guide](https://github.com/riverrun/phauxth/wiki/Getting-started)
shows how you can set up a new Phoenix project with Phauxth.

The wiki also has information about
[authorization](https://github.com/riverrun/phauxth/wiki/Authorization)
and [upgrading existing apps](https://github.com/riverrun/phauxth/wiki/Upgrading-Phauxth-apps).
